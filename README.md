# pandoc-test

test repo for debugging pandoc breakage

prior to version 2.8, this build chain would successfully build the paper but now it errors when creating a pdf.

to reproduce:
```
git clone git@github.com:knaaptime/pandoc-test.git
cd pandoc-test
make environment   # will install deps and pandoc 2.9.1.1
conda activate pandoc-test
make clean
make paper
```
which will fail. 

but downgrading to 2.7.3 will fix the issue

```
conda install  pandoc==2.7.3
make clean; make paper
```

the paper will build into `paper/draft.pdf`


------

Project for doing code-centric academic writing based on
[hfgrif’s fork](https://github.com/hgrif/cookiecutter-ds-python) of the
[cookiecutter data science project template](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/)
and Kieran Healy’s [custom latex styles](https://github.com/hgrif/cookiecutter-ds-python). I
tweaked Kieran’s styles to use open fonts and included them in the paper/.pandoc directory
in case they need to be installed. This template includes everything you need to compile beautiful documents from a set of markdown and Python source files.


## Set up

- clone this repository
- run `make environment` to build the conda environment with necessary dependencies
- run `conda activate pandoc-test` each time you work on the project
- if you make changes to the dependencies, you can run `make environment-update` to rebuild the conda environment to the new specifications

## Use

Write reuseable code in the module directory and jupyter notebooks in the notebooks directory.

- `make notebooks` will execute all notebooks in the notebooks directory
- `make paper` will compile the draft to pdf, html and latex.
- `make revision` if necessary will compile the response to reviewers, the revised draft, and run latex diff on the two drafts 
- use [pandoc-crossref](https://lierdakil.github.io/pandoc-crossref/) syntac to refer to equations, figures, tables, etc without leaving markdown
- use [pandoc-include](https://github.com/DCsunset/pandoc-include) if you prefer to work in external files and reference them from `draft.md`
- when revising a draft, [pandoc-latex-admonitions](https://github.com/chdemko/pandoc-latex-admonition) can be helpful for responding to particular reviewer critiques

You can always drop down into latex in the markdown files if you prefer.
